            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have worked in many industires so far in my young career. Most recent of which being a Digital Marketing position at a Senior Living company in Bonita Spring, FL. In marketing it is essentail to work with your team to find the best and most responded to ads possible for the greatest possible reach and conversion.</p>
        
          <p>Some of my other hobbies include: 
              <ol class="center">
                  <li>Camping</li>
                    <li>Sports</li>
                  <li>Video Games</li>
              </ol>
            Nothing beats a good early morning run, or sitting out by the fire late at night, or getting on my pc to talk to all of my friends that are scattered around the country.</p>
